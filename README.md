# Blender Guide for Beginners

I don't use blender every day, so every time I come back I've forgotten some of the most basic commands and need to google them again and watch some lengthy videos for find out simple answers.

To save time in the future I'll collect those answers here, in a very condensed format, accompanied by screenshots when needed.
